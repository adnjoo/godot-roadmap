## Why I Built This

Godot docs are powerful… but overwhelming when you're starting out.
I wanted a **clear path** I could follow myself — and decided to share it publicly.

This roadmap focuses on:

* learning by *building*
* avoiding tutorial hell
* shipping small projects early

## What You'll Learn

Organized into **9 progressive sections**:

1. **Foundations**
   Nodes, scenes, input, signals, resources. Build your first playable prototype.

2. **2D Essentials**
   Sprites, tilemaps, collisions, physics, animations.

3. **UI Systems**
   Menus, HUDs, dialogs, themes, layout containers.

4. **Game Systems**
   State machines, save/load, events, data-driven design.

5. **Content Pipeline**
   Asset organization, imports, scalable project structure.

6. **Tools & Automation**
   Editor scripts, plugins, export presets.

7. **Performance & Optimization**
   Profiling, draw calls, physics optimization.

8. **Shipping & Distribution**
   Exporting, publishing to itch.io & Steam.

9. **Advanced Topics**
   Multiplayer, shaders, 3D, custom rendering.
