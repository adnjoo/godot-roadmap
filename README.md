# Godot Game Developer Roadmap (2026)

A comprehensive learning path for game developers who want to master Godot. This roadmap guides you from absolute beginner to advanced game developer with 60+ learning items and 7 practice projects.

## What You'll Learn

This roadmap covers everything you need to build games with Godot, organized into 9 progressive sections:

1. **Foundations**: Master the core concepts—nodes, scenes, input handling, signals, and resources. Build your first playable prototype.

2. **2D Essentials**: Create engaging 2D games with sprites, tilemaps, collision detection, physics, and animation systems.

3. **UI Systems**: Design polished interfaces using Control nodes, themes, containers, and dialogs for menus, HUDs, and game UI.

4. **Game Systems**: Implement robust game architecture with state machines, save/load systems, event management, and data-driven design.

5. **Content Pipeline**: Organize and manage assets efficiently, configure import settings, and build scalable project structures.

6. **Tools & Automation**: Extend Godot with editor scripts, plugins, and export presets to streamline your workflow.

7. **Performance & Optimization**: Profile your games, optimize draw calls, improve physics performance, and ensure smooth gameplay.

8. **Shipping & Distribution**: Prepare your game for release with proper export settings, and learn to publish on itch.io and Steam.

9. **Advanced Topics**: Explore multiplayer networking, shaders, 3D game development, and custom rendering techniques.
